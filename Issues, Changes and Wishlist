04-20-2025:
- Changed Beacon of Faith and Beacon of Light function in Raid to utilize Target and Mouseover instead of Focus and Mouseover. This should reduce/near eliminate mid-fight BoF/BoL spam attempts due to tank detection issues when the raid is split. Why? Because Target is typically/always on Enemy and unless you mouseover a tank during a fight and your group is split, it is unlikely to trigger the function.
  The macros for BoF/BoL will need to be changed to: 
  /cast [@target,help][@mouseover,help][@focus,help]Beacon of Light 
  /cast [@target,help][@mouseover,help][@focus,help]Beacon of Faith /cast [@focus,help]Beacon of Virtue
- Added Mouseover Dispel function that specifically cleanses Kinetic Explosive Gel in Floodgate Dungeon when you mouseover an ally Party Frame
      "if A.Cleanse:IsReady(mouseover) and MouseHasFrame() and Unit(mouseover):HasDeBuffs(473713) > 0 and combatTime > 0 then
		     	return A.Cleanse:Show(icon)
			 end"

- Fixed Blessing of Sacrifice attempts on self/player

04-15-2025:
- Added rotation adjustment for Veneration
- Modified higher priority Judgment to be used with appropriate Awakening Buff + Party HP conditions

Known issues:
- Sometimes when you switch talents off of Virtue to BoF/BoL, you need to Reload UI cause rotation still detects that BoV is still learned
- Not all new active talents are added. I use the talent builds from WoWHead for M+/Raid
- Beacon of Light/Faith application has detection issues at times
- Some anticipatory defensive usage is added, not all
- Only trinket added is Soulletting Ruby
- I'm having an issue with copying and pasting my snippets into a brand new TMW profile. It simply leaves TMW blank as if nothing was added. I have to import another dev's profile sometimes and past over their snippets with my own to get my profile to load. Hopefully this doesn't affect the Import file.

Wishlist:
- Separate dispel function for Mouseover/MouseHasFrame for Gel cleanse during paired boss in Floodgate
- Fix BoF/BoL issues with OutOfCombat target + mouseover functionality
- Improve damage downtime gap of Crusader Strike/Holy Shock when party is at full HP
