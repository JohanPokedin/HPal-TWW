Known issues:
- Not all new active talents are added. I use the talent builds from WoWHead for M+/Raid
- Beacon of Light/Faith application has detection issues at times
- Some anticipatory defensive usage is added, not all
- Only trinket added is Soulletting Ruby
- I'm having an issue with copying and pasting my snippets into a brand new TMW profile. It simply leaves TMW blank as if nothing was added. I have to import another dev's profile sometimes and past over their snippets with my own to get my profile to load sometimes. Hopefully this doesn't affect the Import file.
