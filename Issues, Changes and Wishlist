FYI:
This profile is not fully WASD and not fully optimized. It is very capable of healing Mythic raid or high level keys in the hands of an experienced user but there are things that are not done well for you like using of HoJ/Blinding Light because I am not that good at coding functions for those things. It also still has a BoF/BoL bug. Since I have a lot of experience
with my own rotation, I understand how to work around these things using Toggles and AntiFake functions. If you're relatively new to GGL, you will probably have many questions or think that this rotation could use a lot more improvement (yes it could) but I am always available to try to help you as best as I can. The Setup Guide isn't perfect but will give you a headstart.

I recommend using Ellesmere's WA for BoF/BoL application detection.

08-30-2025:
- Removed Putrid Water conditions
- Removed Money Order from Defensives and added Fan Mail
- Added function to hold Freedom if target/nameplate is casting Cosmic Singularity (I haven't tested this yet)
- Edited HoJ condition to check CantTouchThis
- Added Blinding Light function to be used if 2 or more blindable enemies are casting and added CantTouchThis condition
- Added Mouseover dispels for Time Bomb, Cultivated Poison, Explosive Kinetic Gel (if you mouseover an ally with this debuff, it will cleanse them)
- Added minimum elapsed time conditions for Time Bomb, Cultivated Poison, Explosive Kinetic Gel (if you have Dispel Sniper and Cleanse active, it will dispel Kinetic Gel when it is at 6 or less seconds, Time Bomb at 20 or less, Cultivated Poison at 7 or less)
	This gives you 2 methods of dispelling these time-sensitive debuffs. Leave Dispel Sniper on and hope that the timing is fine or manually mouseover allies during these fights and don't add the spellID to your Dispel Auras (or toggle Cleanse + Dispel Sniper off during the fight)
- Cleaned up a few old functions
- Cleaned up ProfileUI
- Added condition similar to Freedom's to prevent Blinding Light/HoJ from going off on Grasping Blood when last boss Arak is casting Cosmic Singularity
- Added redundant mouseover functions for Rebuke/HoJ/Blinding Light on Grasping Blood cast for last boss Arak fight
- Attempted to fix AntiFakeKick issues with channeled spells (also attempting to fix issue with last boss Arak fight, but due to redundant mouseover functions, will not be able to test this on that specific spell)

08-24-2025:
- Added some defensives for Halls of Atonement and Dawnbreaker
- Removed anticipatory cast check for Blessing of Virtue
- Edited ProfileUI settings for Blessing of Virtue use and loosened up the Units/HP Percentages
- Added high priority usage of FoL when Infusion of Light is available/Beacon of Virtue is available
- Made a few edits to the Holy Setup Guide (Talents = Ellesmere Solar Infusion Builds, Holy Tab settings slightly changed in BoV)

06-02-2025:
- Added Spouting Stout and Fluttering Wing to Defensives
- Removed Happy Hour from Defensives

05-31-2025:
- Loosened up DivineToll healing condition to 2 or less Holy Power instead of 1 or less.
- Allowed Holy Shock Damage to be used down to 30% mana instead of 80%

04-20-2025:
- Changed Beacon of Faith and Beacon of Light function in Raid to utilize Target and Mouseover instead of Focus and Mouseover. This should reduce/near eliminate mid-fight BoF/BoL spam attempts due to tank detection issues when the raid is split. Why? Because Target is typically/always on Enemy and unless you mouseover a tank during a fight and your group is split, it is unlikely to trigger the function.
  The macros for BoF/BoL will need to be changed to: 
  /cast [@target,help][@mouseover,help][@focus,help]Beacon of Light 
  /cast [@target,help][@mouseover,help][@focus,help]Beacon of Faith /cast [@focus,help]Beacon of Virtue
  Macros in the guide have been updated to reflect this change
- Added Mouseover Dispel function that specifically cleanses Kinetic Explosive Gel in Floodgate Dungeon when you mouseover an ally Party Frame
      "if A.Cleanse:IsReady(mouseover) and MouseHasFrame() and Unit(mouseover):HasDeBuffs(473713) > 0 and combatTime > 0 then
		     	return A.Cleanse:Show(icon)
			 end"
  I suggest that you utilize this function instead of adding the spellID to your dispel auras

04-17-2025:
- Fixed Blessing of Sacrifice attempts on self/player

04-15-2025:
- Added rotation adjustment for Veneration
- Modified higher priority Judgment to be used with appropriate Awakening Buff + Party HP conditions

Known issues:
- Sometimes when you switch talents off of Virtue to BoF/BoL, you need to Reload UI cause rotation still detects that BoV is still learned
- Not all new active talents are added. I use the talent builds from WoWHead for M+/Raid
- Beacon of Light/Faith application has detection issues at times
- Some anticipatory defensive usage is added, not all
- Only trinket added is Soulletting Ruby
- I'm having an issue with copying and pasting my snippets into a brand new TMW profile. It simply leaves TMW blank as if nothing was added. I have to import another dev's profile sometimes and past over their snippets with my own to get my profile to load. Hopefully this doesn't affect the Import file.

Wishlist:
- Fix BoF/BoL issues with OutOfCombat target + mouseover functionality
