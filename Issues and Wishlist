Known issues:
- Cleanse function seems to have a problem with Self-dispels so I added a redundant function that triggers Cleanse on self in the Healing Rotation. I think the problem stems from GetMembersAll or AuraIsValid
- Not all new active talents are added. (Added Holy Bulwark, Rite of Sanctification, Avenging Crusader so far)

Resolved issues:
- LOH icon shows even when on cooldown (resolved thanks to LUC1D DREAM - was a spellID issue)
- LOD doesn't get used enough in raid encounters (resolved. Removed unitID from IsReady() and it uses it well now)

Wishlist:
Pre-BOF Frozen Binds
Automated Defensive use in response to boss events (probably reliant on Nameplate + Spellcast detection)
